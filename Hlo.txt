1.	Initializing a Repository:
o	To start using Git, you typically initialize a new repository (or repo) in your project directory. This is done with the command git init.
2.	Working Directory:
o	Your project files exist in the working directory. These are the files you are actively working on.
3.	Staging:
o	Before you commit changes, you need to stage them. Staging allows you to select which changes you want to include in the next commit. You use the git add command to stage changes selectively or all at once with git add ..
4.	Committing:
o	After you've staged your changes, you commit them with a message explaining what you've done. Commits create snapshots of your project at that point in time. You use the git commit command to make commits, like git commit -m "Add new feature".
5.	Local Repository:
o	Commits are stored in your local repository. Your project's version history is preserved there.
6.	Branching:
o	Git encourages branching for development. You can create branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Use the git branch and git checkout commands for branching.
7.	Merging:
o	After you've completed work in a branch and want to integrate it into the main codebase, you perform a merge. Merging combines the changes from one branch into another. Use the git merge command.
8.	Remote Repository:
o	For collaboration, you can work with remote repositories hosted on servers like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These repositories serve as a central hub for sharing code.
9.	Pushing:
o	To share your local commits with a remote repository, you push them using the git push command. This updates the remote repository with your changes.
10.	Pulling:
o	To get changes made by others in the remote repository, you pull them to your local repository with the git pull command. This ensures that your local copy is up to date.
11.	Conflict Resolution:
o	Conflicts can occur when multiple people make changes to the same part of a file. Git will inform you of conflicts, and you must resolve them by editing the affected files manually.
12.	Collaboration:
o	Developers can collaborate by pushing, pulling, and making pull requests in a shared remote repository. Collaboration tools like pull requests are commonly used on platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
13.	Tagging and Releases:
o	You can create tags to mark specific points in the project's history, such as version releases. Tags are useful for identifying significant milestones.
14.	Continuous Cycle:
o	The Git lifecycle continues as you repeat these steps over time to manage the ongoing development and evolution of your project. This cycle supports collaborative and agile software development.

The Git lifecycle allows for effective version control, collaboration, and the management of complex software projects. It provides a structured approach to tracking and sharing changes, enabling multiple developers to work to
